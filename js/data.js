      "This is a fun game, but it is definitely unbalanced as you will face many opponents who are overdevelop, and in some cases is an automatic loss no matter how well you play. And there are a lot of connectivity issues (not from my side) that occur and weird popups that stop you from even playing and you just end up losing for no good reason. Still fun but I will only keep this at 3 stars for now.",

      "I enjoy this game a lot, and I play it every day(and have been for 7 or 8 months). I really enjoy the strategy aspect and how there are so many cards to experiment with and choose from. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, it becomes increasingly hard to progress yourself. On Trophy Road especially, I find myself getting matched into opponents with exceptionally higher level cards than mine. Though this game does require skill, people with 2 or 3 levels higher than you will destroy you.",

      "This is an incredible game! I've been playing for years, and it is still enjoyable. However, I do have one issue The matchmaking. I don't understand it. 90% of my battles are against players higher level then me, and it's frustrating because it creates an uneven game. I understand it relies on who is playing atm, but this could be changed be decreasing the trophies lost in the season reset, ensuring the same level of people are together. I wouldn't even mind waiting longer for a fair game",

      "Since the crashing issue has been foxed, I am now happy to give this game 5 stars. The graphics are simple, though quite charming. The controls are very simple and easy to learn. The game does have microtransactions, and though they do speed up progress, I don't think they give you a significant advantage over F2P players like myself. Updates are consistent and new content and events are being added all the time. Definitely pick this one up if you've never tried it.",

      "This game is good, if you aren't good. Let me explain. As you progress through the game, you level up you cards. However, your level has *no* effect on your matching. That is based upon your total wins, measured in trophies. This causes a huge rift in players. For example, I am currently fighting level 13-15 players when I am level 10. I don't even stand a chance. The rare occasion of a win makes me stay high crowns and forces me to fight higher level enemies. In short, game good. System horrid.",
