      Clash Royale is an online multiplayer game where players battle in
      real-time to destroy the opposing towers, with the aim to win crowns,
      trophies and glory. The game features four main game modes: 1v1, 2v2,
      Touchdown, and a new game mode called "Duels". A player wins a battle by
      destroying more towers than the opponent, or by destroying the opponent's
      "King's Tower", which grants an automatic three "crown" victory. At the
      start of each game, both players are given a "hand" of four cards from a
      "deck" of eight cards chosen by the player. Cards can be used to attack
      and defend. To play the cards, the player must have enough "elixir", one
      elixir automatically being replenished every 2.8 seconds (every 1.4
      seconds during "Double Elixir", every 0.7 seconds during "Triple Elixir",
      and every 0.35 seconds during "Rage"). Once a card is placed, a new card
      from the deck is drawn to the hand.
