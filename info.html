    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
      Clash Royale is a game where you assemble a deck of cards to deploy units
      and destroy your opponent’s towers. The matches last three minutes, and if
      both players have the same number of crowns (or none), the match goes into
      a two-minute overtime where the first tower destroyed wins. The main goal
      is to destroy the King’s Tower in the middle, while protecting your own.
      You can also join clans, chat with other players, and participate in
      special events.

    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>
      There are many tips and tricks to improve your gameplay in Clash Royale.
      Here are some of the most common ones:
      <!-- Use list -->
      <li>
        Be patient and don’t rush your attacks. Wait for the right moment to
        deploy your units and counter your opponent’s moves
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn how to count elixir and keep track of your opponent’s elixir
        spending. This will help you gain an elixir advantage and plan your
        strategy accordingly
      </li>
      <li>
        Know when to stop pushing and defend your towers. Sometimes, it’s better
        to let go of a tower and focus on defending the other ones or preparing
        for a counterattack
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a versatile and powerful deck that can deal with different
        situations and threats. Try to balance your deck with different types of
        units, such as tanks, swarmers, splashers, spellers, etc
      </li>
      <li>
        Don’t waste elixir or gems. Use them wisely to upgrade your cards,
        unlock chests, or buy special offers. Don’t spend them on random things
        or speed up chests that you can open for free
      </li>
