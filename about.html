  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    This website is created by <strong>Chi-Wei Perng</strong> for the final
    project of <strong>WEB222</strong> course. The purpose of this website is to
    provide information about the game <strong>Clash Royale</strong> and allow
    users to post their reviews about the game.

  <p>
    I start playing this game because my friends recommended it to me. I have
    been playing this game for more than 5 years and I really enjoy it. The
    playing time of this game is short, which is perfect for me because I don't
    have much time to play games. I also like the strategy part of this game.
    It's fun to think about how to counter your opponent's moves and how to use
    your cards effectively.
